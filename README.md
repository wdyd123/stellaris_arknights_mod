本mod缺少测试,如果游戏闪退那大概率是我的问题
另外需要注意，本mod重载了原版的部分岗位，时间，建筑，特质以确保本mod对官方内容的兼容性。所以任何有相似行为的(对官方内容进行修改的)其他mod与本mod大概率不兼容，但是UImod，舰船mod，物种mod，立绘mod应该可以兼容。


2025.8.8
基本完成了源石飞升的所有效果和所有事件，对原版的一些特质进行了重载以适配新飞升。添加了一
几张图片。


2025年8月6日  
源石飞升框架已基本实现，但传统树的效果尚未完成，还有点其他修改。抑制剂的产量还不是很合理(开局就是负的)，后边再调整。

2025.8.1
实现了源石技艺版的自动改造特质,特质具体效果还有待修改,每月自动改造人口数我也考虑修改一下,原版的有点垃圾.
工匠现在会产出矿石病抑制剂,源石技艺特质以后都会增加抑制剂维护.
矿工会产出少量源石,以供前期使用.

2025.7.29
实现了源石的生产,目前没有前置科技,产量机制同纳米机器人。

2025.7.24
修改了干员立绘尺寸,以及干员立绘设置的逻辑,现在应该不会串立绘,也不会顶破天花板了

2025.7.22
完善了抽卡机制,更新了五星干员的逻辑,导入了一部分干员立绘.前天写了两个批处理文件想批量改干员图像,发现鹰角的立绘没有那么好批处理,还是手动处理吧.

2025.7.20
增加了初级的抽卡机制，干员的特质/法令消耗和冷却/干员立绘会在后边陆续更新,算是初步具有一点点可玩性了

明日方舟mod的雏形,基本处于画饼阶段,以后会更新其他内容。大概内容包括
1、种族(先不细分黎博利和佩洛之类的,统称泰拉种)
2、特质(泰拉物种自带的源石适应性,以及配套的正侧面buff)
3、传统(在考虑制作类似基飞和合成繁衍)
4、天灾(报告普瑞赛斯,今天也在认真执行源石计划!)
5、建筑(罗德岛基建和办事处)
6、区划(待定)
7、法令(至少要用来抽卡,源石技艺过载然后回收尸体产源石也不是不行)
8、星球决议(散播源石)
9、舰船部件(其实没有想做很多东西,堕落的船就很对我的xp了,)
10、新资源(源石和矿石病抑制剂)
11，领袖。(打算把干员做成凯德斯那样的事件领袖,有自己独特的命定特质(水陈:抓走妈妈))
不过我在美术方面技术力不足，各项内容的具体设计也还没有完成。项目总体进展比较缓慢，而且界园刚开，好想去界园。
This mod lacks testing. If the game crashes, it's most likely my fault.  

Additionally, please note that this mod overrides some vanilla jobs, timers, buildings, and traits to ensure compatibility with official content. Therefore, any other mods with similar behavior (those that modify vanilla content) will most likely be incompatible. However, UI mods, ship mods, species mods, and portrait mods should work fine.  

**2025.8.8**  
- Basically completed all effects and events for the Originium Ascension path.  
- Overrode some vanilla traits to fit the new ascension mechanics.  
- Added a few new images.

**2025.8.1**

Implemented the Originium Arts version of auto-mod traits. The specific effects of traits still need to be adjusted, and I'm also considering modifying the monthly auto-mod population count - the vanilla version is pretty garbage.

Artisans now produce Oripathy Suppressants, and all Originium Arts traits will require suppressant maintenance going forward. 
Miners will produce small amounts of originium for early game use.

2025.7.29
Implemented the production of Originium, with no prerequisite technology. The production mechanism is the same as that of Nanobots.

July 24, 2025
Modified the operator portrait size and the logic for setting operator portraits. Now, there should be no more portrait overlap, and they won’t exceed the limits.

July 22, 2025
"I improved the gacha mechanism, updated the logic for 5-star operators, and imported some operator portraits. A couple of days ago, I wrote two batch files to bulk modify the operator images, but I found that Hypergryph's portraits aren't that easy to batch process, so I’ll just do it manually."

July 20, 2025
"I added a basic gacha mechanism. The operators' traits, edict costs and cooldowns, as well as their portraits, will be updated gradually. It's starting to have a little bit of playability."

The prototype of the Arknights mod is still in its early  stage, and more content will be added in the future. The planned features roughly include:

Species
(Not differentiating between races like Liberi or Perro for now—collectively referred to as “Terra species”, or "Originoid")

Traits
(Innate Originium Adaptability for Terran species, along with a set of corresponding positive and negative traits)

Traditions
(Considering mechanics similar to Gestalt Consciousness and Syncretic Evolution  (multi-stages-situation with senior authorities)  )

Catastrophes
("Reporting in, Prts! I’m carrying out the Originium Plan seriously again today!")
(initial stages would be like cosmogenesis, final stages requires palyer to build five halos, and accumulate adequate originium to start them(no master-chief in stellaris))

Buildings
(Rhodes Island infrastructure and administration offices)

Districts
(To be determined)

Edicts
(At the very least, these will be used for gacha mechanics. Originium Arts overload leading to corpse recycling for Originium isn’t off the table either.)

Planetary Decisions
(Spreading Originium(kinda like the nanorobots, output grows with time, or just simply add a planetary modifier))

Ship Components
(I don't actually plan to make many, but fallen empires' ships are really into me.)

New Resources
(Originium and Oripathy Suppressants)

Leaders
(Planning to implement operators as Cadence-style event leaders, each with unique destined traits.)

However, I currently lack the necessary artistic skills, and the specific content designs are still incomplete. Overall progress is relatively slow. Besides... Jieyuan just opened, and I really want to go explore it.
