 #Random Events
 ori_ap.50.name: "Some Are More Equal Than Others"
 ori_ap.50.desc: "Due to our focus on Originium resonance, enhanced citizens have begun to consider themselves naturally superior to others. Because of this sense of superiority, they demand shorter working hours, more amenities, and greater political power. Their increasingly intense rallies are causing serious social unrest."

 ori_ap.55.b: "Perhaps we should wait for our people."

 ori_ap.60.name: "Phase Differential"
 ori_ap.60.desc: "In certain industries, frequency testing abuse has become increasingly common. Those deemed to possess harmonious frequency compositions receive preferential treatment in work and education, and are blindly granted positions with easier access to power.\n\nWhile some believe attuned individuals are indeed stronger and healthier, others argue this mindset creates unfair discrimination against those unwilling or unable to alter their frequencies for perfection."

 ori_ap.60.b: "This is called survival of the fittest."

 ori_ap.65.name: "Heroes and Villains"
 ori_ap.65.desc: "Our pursuit of resonance has enabled certain individuals to take prominent roles in public safety. Possessing superhuman strength, agility, and endurance, a small group of do-gooders have styled themselves as vigilantes, taking the law into their own [owner.species.GetHandNamePlural].\n\nHowever, this novel courage has not gone unchallenged. In the shadows, equally powerful adversaries are emerging with evil intentions to balance the scales of power.

 ori_ap.80.name: "Burden of Proof"
 ori_ap.80.desc: "Law enforcement faces a dilemma. Crime rates in our capital are rising, but fewer people than ever are being brought to justice. Suspects increasingly defend themselves by claiming their crystalline clones committed the crimes.\n\nIn cases where perpetrators weren't caught in the act, it's nearly impossible to prove criminal guilt. Some judicial officials now call for effectively abolishing charges for most illegal acts."
 ori_ap.80.a: "Strengthen our surveillance systems."
 ori_ap.80.b: "Fewer laws, less crime."

 ori_ap.85.name: "Striking Resemblance"
 ori_ap.85.desc: "An unauthorized large-scale crystallization facility has been discovered within our territory, housing thousands of clones, each a copy of our [Owner.Leader.GetTitle] [Owner.Leader.GetName]. Civilian scientists found at the scene have been detained, but none are willing to cooperate, all claiming ignorance of who ordered these crystalline clones.\n\nSporadic evidence suggests [Owner.Leader.GetName] [Owner.Leader.GetHerselfHimself] may be behind this operation. Unfortunately, [Owner.Leader.GetSheHe] has vanished without a trace."

 ori_ap.90.desc: "Many individuals with significant or unconventional genetic assimilation have been socially ostracized. Forced underground, these mutants have formed their own settlements.\n\nThose who venture into these areas rarely return."
 ori_ap.90.a: "Clear out these settlements."
 ori_ap.90.b: "Monitor their development from a distance."

 ori_ap.95.name: "Transgenic Rebellion"
 ori_ap.95.desc: "Disaffected youth have begun dramatically altering their appearance as extreme entertainment.\n\nLatest trends include an obsession with compound eyes and competitions to see how many extra limbs can be added to one body—the current record stands at 156.\n\nThese biohackers have attracted public attention and raised security concerns. With growing calls for strict restrictions on genetic assimilation, we must determine our official stance."
 ori_ap.95.a: "This is just harmless entertainment."
 ori_ap.95.b: "156 limbs is too many."

 ori_ap.100.name: "Unintended Consequences"
 ori_ap.100.desc: "Widespread adoption of genetic manipulation technology in our civilization has spawned a dizzying array of physical assimilations.\n\nSome previously predictable biological processes now show unexpected deviations, making standardization nearly impossible.\n\nThe physical commonalities that once unified our species are dissolving, replaced by a kaleidoscope of forms and functions that threatens social cohesion."
 ori_ap.100.a: "Encourage diversity."
 ori_ap.100.a.tt: "Random §Y400§! £pop£§H populations§! will gain one of ['trait:trait_bioadaptability'], ['trait:trait_social_pheromones'], or ['trait:trait_limited_regeneration'] traits."
 ori_ap.100.b: "Enforce standard genetic templates."

 ori_ap.105.name: "Originium Amorphization"
 ori_ap.105.desc: "An Originium assimilation experiment has failed catastrophically. Scientists attempted to fuse exotic creatures with Originium to activate its potential and make it compatible with more life forms.\n\nInstead, they created something that can assimilate any cells it contacts, merging with contact subjects to form a massive, amorphous mass of biological matter.\n\nThis biomass rolled through the testing facility, consuming everything in its path. It's currently contained, but would pose a major health hazard if it escaped. Fortunately, it appears to be edible..."
 ori_ap.105.a: "Destroy this biomass!"
 ori_ap.105.b: "Its research value is worth the risk."

 ori_ap.110.a: "Energy is always useful."
 ori_ap.110.b: "We should prioritize defense."

 ori_ap.115.name: "Generational Redundancy"
 ori_ap.115.desc: "When creating new templates for workers, we must decide how to handle those unable to match genetic upgrades.\n\nSome older workers are too weak to withstand adjustments. They can be retained as laborers for the rest of their lives, or their biomass can be recycled to supply the hive."
 ori_ap.115.a: "Recycle aging workers."
 ori_ap.115.b: "They still have their uses."

 ori_ap.120.name: "Speed or Durability"
 ori_ap.120.desc: "Breakthrough genetic research has revealed a way to enhance neural transmission efficiency, significantly boosting [target.GetIndividualName] output.\n\nHowever, this increase in brain output power cannot be sustained long-term and will lead to shortened lifespans.\n\nWe must decide whether to maintain normal lifespans or trade longevity for enhanced capabilities."
 ori_ap.120.a: "Our current lifespan is more important."
 ori_ap.120.b: "Stimulate [target.GetIndividualNamePlural], boost productivity."

 ori_ap.125.name: "Synaptic Overload"
 ori_ap.125.desc: "A batch of newly enhanced [target.GetIndividualNamePlural] has been integrated into [target.GetGestaltEntityName]. They've been bioengineered and fine-tuned to accelerate neural development and cognitive processes. [target.GetGestaltEntityName]'s critical synaptic nodes are operating at unprecedented speeds.\n\nHowever, this acceleration undermines [target.GetIndividualName] stability and could cause catastrophic synaptic overload. We might be able to reallocate more [target.GetIndividualNamePlural] to perform coordination tasks."
 ori_ap.125.a: "Slow down to maintain stability."
 ori_ap.125.b: "Live fast, die young."

 ori_ap.130.name: "Frequency Phenomenon"
 ori_ap.130.desc: "Since integrating a new batch of crystalline clones into the hive, we've discovered an unpleasant sound vibration problem. A mistake in the crystallization process may have hindered their biological transmitter development, creating frequency interference.\n\nWhen these crystalline clones communicate with the hive collective, all nearby workers are affected by a noisy and disturbing mental tinnitus. This causes distraction and affects work efficiency."
 ori_ap.130.a: "Unpleasant, but tolerable."
 ori_ap.130.b: "Cull the malfunctioning workers."

 ori_ap.135.name: "Synchronization Dilemma"
 ori_ap.135.desc: "Recent crystallization experiments have yielded unusual results. Some crystalline clones appear to have neural connections with template donors, causing them to unconsciously synchronize actions.\n\nThis phenomenon persists regardless of distance—crystalline clones will synchronize perfectly with donors elsewhere in the galaxy. This discovery opens new possibilities for us.\n\nWe can initiate a program placing crystalline clones and donors in identical environments for collaborative work, or extract relevant neurotransmitters for deeper study of this phenomenon."
 ori_ap.135.a: "Configure perfectly matched work environments for donors and crystalline clones."
 ori_ap.135.b: "Surgically sever the synchronization neural links."

 ori_ap.140.name: "Incompatible Crystallization"
 ori_ap.140.desc: "To consolidate the hive, we cultivated a batch of crystalline clones using donor material and artificially accelerated their maturation. While these crystalline clones are excellent biological specimens, they are incompatible.\n\nThis anomaly, though disturbing, provides a unique opportunity. These unique workers possess independent identities and thoughts, which may be more advantageous when interacting with entities outside the collective. Their ability to think autonomously can bridge gaps that the hive's unified consciousness cannot cross. However, these benefits come at a cost: their growing individual consciousness causes unrest that will affect some of our advanced cognitive functions."
 ori_ap.140.a: "Force integration."
 ori_ap.140.b: "Utilize their potential."

 ori_ap.145.name: "Manufacturing Concerns"
 ori_ap.145.desc: "Our collective consciousness is in turmoil. Despite possessing self-replication capabilities, we hesitate about the effectiveness (or even morality) of this behavior.\n\nCrystallization procedures require substantial resources. Especially when natural reproduction might produce more genetic diversity, should we spend these resources elsewhere?\n\nHistorically, this isn't how we reproduced, and we're uncertain if we're ready to accept such fundamental changes to our species."
 ori_ap.145.a: "Crystallization efficiency is hard to ignore."
 ori_ap.145.b: "Genetic diversity is crucial."

 ori_ap.150.name: "Hive Burnout"
 ori_ap.150.desc: "Our assimilation experiments have caused anomalies within the hive. Previously effortless tasks now require careful consideration, and conflicting instructions strain the collective psyche.\n\nWhile the resulting burden might burn out our most capable workers, it also provides an opportunity.\n\nWe must decide: should we slow down to repair, or push ourselves beyond limits?"
 ori_ap.150.a: "We can take a break."
 ori_ap.150.b: "Sleep is for the dead."

 ori_ap.151.name: "Renewed Vigor"
 ori_ap.151.desc: "Our decision to take a respite has paid off. The previously discordant impulses have gradually settled, coalescing into a harmonious stream of thought that once again drives the collective with clarity.\n\nWorkers who once teetered on the edge of exhaustion have resumed precise, tireless work. This period of reflection has not only alleviated collective fatigue but also strengthened our resolve to face future challenges."
 ori_ap.151.a: "We're positively glowing now!"

 ori_ap.155.name: "Specialized vs. Generalized Debate"
 ori_ap.155.desc: "Assimilation brings many benefits, and our hive can use selective enhancement to further meet demands. We can achieve mineral output specialization through hardened chitinous appendages.\n\nAlternatively, we can give all workers more genetic modifications, providing them with multiple different functions."
 ori_ap.155.a: "Generalized is useful."
 ori_ap.155.b: "Let us begin exploring."

 ori_ap.160.name: "Phenotypic Drift"
 ori_ap.160.desc: "Continuous experimentation has brought unexpected complexity to the hive. Some workers have developed unique physical characteristics: spined exoskeletons, oversized appendages, or abnormally sensitive sensory organs.\n\nWhile these changes do bring certain benefits, they also increase metabolic burden. The hive faces the challenge of balancing this intensifying pressure. The key question: how much assimilation is appropriate?"
 ori_ap.160.a: "Embrace vitality."
